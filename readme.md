Folders contain Load Test, Spike Test, and Stress Test for task 3.

CRUD TASK Description
In the CRUDTests folder are 4 folders called LOAD, SOAK, SPIKE, STRESS. Inside these are .jmx files for each along with their reports.

Each test plan creates a list, then creates, reads, updates, deletes an item in that list. And then reads, updates, and deletes the list.

Each CRUD function is in a seperate controller to further improve readability.
